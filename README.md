Description:
This Python GitHub project is focused on creating an end-to-end data pipeline that generates random data using Python, streams the data through AWS Kinesis, processes it using AWS Lambda, and stores the data in an AWS S3 Bucket. The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate the seamless integration of these modern cloud technologies and showcase how they can be leveraged to easily create scalable and serverless data pipelines.


Key features of this project include:
1. A Python script to generate random data in a specified format, suitable for simulating real-world data like sensor readings, user activity logs, etc.
2. Utilizing AWS Kinesis to create a data stream that receives the generated data and ensures real-time processing with low latency.
3. Implementing an AWS Lambda function to process the incoming data from the Kinesis stream, enabling custom transformations, filtering, or aggregation of the data.
4. An AWS S3 Bucket for storing the processed data, making it readily available for analysis, visualization, or integration into other applications and services.
5. Detailed documentation and examples on how to set up and configure all the necessary AWS resources, as well as guidance on deploying and testing the project.
